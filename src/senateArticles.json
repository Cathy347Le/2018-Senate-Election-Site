Martha McSally — who was appointed to McCain’s seat after losing her 2018 bid for the state’s other seat — is expected to run to finish off the last two years of McCain’s term.",

And control of Capitol Hill will affect the ability of the president to get things done to start the next decade. In the Senate, Republicans picked up a couple of seats in November. ",
